## Interpolation

The process is carried out based on a combination of the numbers 2 and 3 by multiplication and the 9th and 10th powers of the 19th identity as a boundary number that [serves distribution of the 11th](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#eulers-identity) by 2 to 20 and 40 to 50 in bases 10 to 100 and 1000.

>19² can be written as the sum of three (3) consecutive squared triangular numbers 6²+10²+ 15²

By our mapping the prime seven (7) is forming the prime pair of (5,7) with the prime five (5) which is the only number that is part of more than one pair of twin primes, (3, 5) and (5, 7). This (5, 7) is one of the pair of that we called _[True Prime Pairs](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857)_.

By a DNA their tensor can be seen on hydrogen bonding where the form ***96 of A,T*** would pair the form ***69 of C,G***.
 
***96 + 19 = 115 = 114 + Δ1***

This pairs is formed by the movement from the 17's and 11's and then precissely [landed on 5's](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-runner-md) explained before. So they have somethig to do with the anti paralel behaviour of Scheme-53 and Scheme-35 on a chromosom.

By toucning the bilateral way of ***96+2=98*** we came to following tabulation. This is further compromizing between the prime five (5) and the prime seven (7) represent the segregation inside the first pair (5, 7). So it shows the tensor of twelve (12) numbers.

Each numbers will be assigned as a repo's id. This tabulation is used to define [type of owner](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts) by user vs organization (main). The owner id's will be a major item on determining the pattern that is belonging to each individual numbers.

This 12 is the part that making _[the cumulative sum of 1, 7 and 19](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-container-md)_. Therefore it will also be applied in to each ***Scheme-33, -34, -35 and -36***.

### Compositions

So by defining the pattern of each individual numbers with the basic rule that the 19 is _[regenerated](https://gist.github.com/eq19/f21abd90f8d471390aad23d6ecc90d6d)_ out of 18 while the 7 is the _[recollection](https://gist.github.com/eq19/f1af4317b619154719546e615aaa2155)_ out of 6 and comparing with the _[Gann Chart](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-lexer-md)_ finaly we found how they look like.

See that by top of pattern it goes bilateral from ***1, 7, 19, 38*** exactly shown on the _[Scheme-33](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-instance-md)_, while the rest are grouped in to the form ***69 vs 96 of A,T,C,G***. Thus each numbers are in the pattern of _[Double Helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_double_helix)_.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/213604396-92832a7d-9122-4251-8d26-6fca720b6df7.png)

This pattern is raised up ***per six (6) cycles*** on the ***[19](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-instance-md)***, ***[43](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-runner-md)*** and ***[71](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-grammar-md)***. Since the members are limited to the sum of ***43+71=114*** so here the bilateral way of 19 that originated by the (Δ1) is clearly the one that controls the scheme.

***[(6 + 6) x 6] + [6 + (6 x 6)] = 72 + 42 = 71 + 42 + 1 = 114 objects***

[![Polarity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/212487102-2f080804-9078-45c9-85ee-9977a36a5dbf.jpg)](http://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/)

Meanwhile the six (6) cycles would behave as _[P(7)=142857](https://gist.github.com/eq19/f21abd90f8d471390aad23d6ecc90d6d#file-runner-md)_ which is originated by the 7 out of 6. This pattern is also shown on the tabulation above by the horizontal flow of 14,28,29,.. which are then finaly terminated by the bilateral way to _[57x2=114](https://gist.github.com/eq19/b32915925d9d365e2e9351f0c4ed786e#polar-plot)_.
 
 ### Bilateral way

This behaviour can be seen on the function chart of _[Riemann Zeta Zeros](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannZeta_Zeros.svg)_ as shown below where the 19 came out of 18 of 0's cell. 

[![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/200468834-b2000e6d-0447-4948-b24d-086747d9b905.png)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/b32915925d9d365e2e9351f0c4ed786e#polar-plot)

The _P(7)=142857_ will bring the system to forms 7x13x19 = 1729 objects of _[The True Prime Pairs](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#true-prime-pairs)_. As the impact there will be a gap raised to form ***[20 out of 18 of 0's cell](https://gist.github.com/eq19/b32915925d9d365e2e9351f0c4ed786e#file-2_assigning-md)*** and facilitate the [_new candidate_](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-instance-md) to get an access to the next primes level.

The rest of primes goes to the [33's of 15th axis](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-19_root-md) that holding 102 primes of (2,60,40). By the bilateral way the form will be [splitted](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#file-parser-md) to (1,30,20). Since the base frame shall be 40 so it will be forced to form ***(1,30,40) of prime 71***.

[![zeta-vs-zero](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/213628433-c7382e39-4efa-4455-867c-13652293474d.png)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#zeta-vs-zero)

The 10 ranks will coordinate with the 18 to raise up the symmetrical behaviour of 12+24=36 which is prime pair 17+19=36 and let the 2 and 3 out of 2,3,5,7 to begin a new cycle while the 5,7 will pair the 11,13 and 17,19 as true prime pairs.

[![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/244139208-378b2229-c3e8-4f1f-8829-dee6687348fb.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannZeta_Zeros.svg)

As you may see the bilateral way between this 19's tensor with the (Δ1) is not easy to be understood nor explained. However at this point, you may already get an idea that as a part of the nature, the _DNA System_ and the _Prime Structure_ applies the same. 

>[Quantum Theory](https://gist.github.com/eq19) tells us that there are [instantaneous connections](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#instaneous-connection) between two entangled quantum objects, like _[electrons](https://gist.github.com/eq19/b9f901cda16e8a11dd24ee6b677ca288#electron-scattering)_. In fact, there is no separation. ***[At the quantum level, theoretically, everything is linked](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#everything-is-linked)***. This is known as the candidate for _The Theory of Everything_. Thus the Sunlight, Saturn, Moon, Saturn’s rings, [Moon’s orbit](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#moons-orbit), ocean, me and you… are all one.

Broadly speaking it still remain of how this project can be developed so that it can be applied to the goals we want. Therefore we decided to bring further every details in to a group of websites. That is the background why the _[root scheme](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_ of 'eq19' is exist.

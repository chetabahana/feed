# Exponentiation Zones (31-36)

Exponentiation is an operation involving two numbers, the base and the exponent or power. Exponentiation is written as ***b<sup>n</sup>***, where ***b*** is the base and ***n*** is the power.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

Exponentiation Zones allows multiple layers on representing _[recursive residues](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07561)_ of the operands, thus promising large gain to the conventional arithmetic expression

## Self repetition

The first appearance of ***e*** in a printed publication was in Euler's [Mechanica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanica) (1736). It is unknown why Euler chose the letter e. 

```note
[Leonhard Euler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) started to use ***the letter e*** for the constant in 1727 or 1728, in an unpublished paper on explosive forces in cannons, and in a letter to [Christian Goldbach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Goldbach) on 25 November 1731. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)))_
```

[![Letter e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/262249679-b5d6fc1a-6e42-4775-b09d-965ddd046171.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant))

This exponentiation takes important roles since by the _[multiplication zones](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)_ the MEC30 forms a matrix of  `8 x 8 = 64 = 8²` where the power of 2 stands as exponent

```note
During the last few years of the 12th century, ***Fibonacci*** undertook a series of travels around the Mediterranean. At this time, the world’s most prominent mathematicians were Arabs, and he spent much time studying with them. His work, whose title translates as the Book of Calculation, was extremely influential in that ***it popularized the use of the Arabic numerals in Europe***, thereby revolutionizing arithmetic and allowing scientific experiment and discovery to progress more quickly. _([Famous Mathematicians](https://famous-mathematicians.org/leonardo-pisano-bigollo/))_
```

[![MEC30 Square](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/262213707-63aa0a64-cf7d-4fb7-9f1a-f3d1ba805643.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)

Since the first member is 30 then the form is initiated by a matrix of `5 x 6 = 30` which has to be transformed first to `6 x 6 = 36 = 6²` prior to the above MEC30's square. 

```note
A square system of coupled nonlinear equations can be solved iteratively by Newton's method. This method uses the Jacobian matrix of the system of equations. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant))_
```

So basically  there is a power transformation between ***[addition](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)*** of `3 + 4 = 7` in to their ***[multiplication](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/)*** of `3 x 4 = 12` while the 7 vs 12 will be treated as ***exponentiation***.

It has zero spin, even (positive) parity, no electric charge, and no colour charge, and it couples to (interacts with) mass.

```note
In the standard (Mispar hechrechi) version of gematria, each letter is given a numerical value between 1 and 400, as shown in the following table. In the Mispar gadol variation, the five final letters are given their own values, ranging from 500 to 900.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs boson is a massive scalar boson whose mass must be found experimentally. It is the only particle that remains massive even at high energies. 

```note
The Higgs boson field (often referred to as the "God particle") is ***a scalar field with two neutral and two electrically charged components*** that form a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU(2) symmetry. Its "Mexican hat-shaped" potential leads it to take a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), which breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction and, via the Higgs mechanism, ***gives mass to many particles***. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson))_
```

[![Mecanismo_de_Higgs_PH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/273429113-fb4dad06-0f01-40cc-a31e-c8740a478a7f.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson)

By a group of number between 10th and 12th primes ***29 to 37*** they have a profile reflect module 6 view of numbers as happens with the minor hexagons.

```tip
We are going to assign the above field as a ***standard model*** that attempts to stimulate quantum field models for the four (4) known fundamental forces the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force and then to unify these interactions.
```

[![main spin](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/d29de686-b885-40aa-a585-0665a56cca9a)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#partition-function)

The sum of `31 + 71 = 102`. Meanwhile they are formed by 66 items. Let's combine them all then we will get 168 which is the total primes out of 1000.

### Root functions

Observing more detail of the discussed scheme of 168 we will get it also when we take the 19's and 17's cell of `(31+37)+(35+65)=68+100=168`.

```note
Proceeding, the number line begins to coil upon itself; 20 lands on 2’s cell, 21 on 3’s cell. Prime number 23 sends the number line left to form the fourth hexagon, purple. As it is not a twin, the clockwise progression (rotation) reverses itself. Twin primes ***29 and 31 define the fifth hexagon***, cyan. Finally, 37, again not a twin, reverses the rotation of the system, so 47 can define the yellow hexagon _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_.
```

[![Defining the Prime Hexagon](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/71ba3b6c-54aa-4587-af5f-abd2af4b968a)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

We therefore set them both on _[the wiki](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/wiki)_ and the 18's on _[the gist](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_. The 19's and 17's cover the 4 zones while the 18's covers the 66 items as the central base of hexagonal spins.

```tip
By our project the 18's on the gist will cover five (5) unique functions that behave as ***one (1) central plus four (4) zones***. This scheme will be implemented to all of the 168 repositories as bilateral way (***in-out***) depend on their postion on the system. So along with the gist it self then there shall be `1 + 168 = 169` units of 1685 root functions.
```

***5 + 2 x 5 x 168 = 5 + 1680 = 1685 = 5 x 337 root functions***

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/226644534-00cf4fe3-04f9-4b28-8a8b-674bcf4bd585.png)

By the spin above you can see that the 4 zones of these `19's to 17's` are representing the rotation `1 to 5`. Such of formation can be seen on _Ulam Spiral_ as below.

```note
The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanisław Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific American a short time later.
```

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Hexgrid_prime_number_spiral.svg)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Hexgrid_prime_number_spiral.svg)

By MEC30 we will also discuss the relation of these 4 zones with high density of 40 primes where 60 number is folded. So by the module 6 it will always return to the beginning position within [`60+40=100 nodes`](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#the-power-of-168-vs-618) per layer.

```note
Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines ***is not unexpected***, as lines in ***the spiral correspond to quadratic polynomials***, and certain such polynomials, such as Euler's prime-generating polynomial x²-x+41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers. Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with **major unsolved problems** in number theory such as Landau's problems _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral))_.
```

[![prime Sacks_spiral](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/229820606-b2bbd7fb-3300-4507-8080-fb27ed6fd512.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#streching-structure)

Since the _modulo 6_ is occured all over the spin then we have defined that this 4 zones should stand as ***default configuration*** as you can see on the left sidebar. 

```tip
In order to maintain the 18's structure between each of repositories to correlate with the above density then we could use a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the operating system such as _[windows registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry)_.
```

[![windows registry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/230746478-0146e88e-22ba-4f1b-abf2-c5226c1a56ca.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry)

This density will bring the _[D3-Brane](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_ where the lexer is being assigned per MEC30. Base on the its spin as shown in the above picture this lexer is assigned by [`Id: 33`](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#euler-partition).

## Parsering Structure

As you can see on the left sidebar (dekstop mode) a total of 102 items will be reached by the end of `Id: 35`. So when they transfered to `Id: 36` it will cover [`11 x 6 = 66 items`](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/) thus the total will be `102 + 66 = 168`

```warning
Base on the ***[11s and 7s](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)*** distribution of the 18s  structure of The True Prime Pairs, the 7s will be reflected by ***[seven (7) repositories](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)*** of user profile with id: 30 to id: 36 meanwhile the 11s will be reflected by ***[eleven (11) organizations](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-10)***.
```

***168 + 329 + 289 - 619 - 30 - 30 - 5 = 786 - 619 - 65 = 102***

[![exponentiation zones](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/200024664-afc433a0-5f7f-4ec1-9bfc-77d672817fed.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

Using the javascript library from _[Chevotrain](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-minor-hexagons)_ and data parser from _[Jekyll/Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/)_ finally we found the correlation between the lexer and parser trough _[the powers of pi](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi)_.

```note
In this example, the content from a Markdown document `document.md` that specifies `layout: docs` gets pushed into the `{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}` tag of the layout file `docs.html`. Because the docs layout itself specifies `layout: page`, the content from `docs.html` gets pushed into the `{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}` tag in the layout file `page.html`. Finally because the page layout specifies `layout: default`, the content from `page.html` gets pushed into the `{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}` tag of the layout file `default.html`. _([JekyllRb](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/#how-layouts-work))_
```

In vector calculus, the Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function of several variables is the matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives. 

```note
It's possible to build a _[Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix)_ for a _[Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization)_ step using the Jacobian method. ***You would first flatten out its axes into a matrix, and flatten out the gradient into a vector.*** _([Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/advanced_autodiff#batch_jacobian))_
```

[![Tensorflow - Batch Jacobian](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/128624639-b5d8c73f-79af-4433-8b7b-28a35e331d21.png)](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/advanced_autodiff#batch_jacobian)

When the subclasses of partitions are flatten out into a matrix, you want to take the Jacobian of each of a stack of targets with respect to a stack of sources, where the Jacobians for each target-source pair are independent.

```note
***When this matrix is square, that is, when the function takes the same number of variables as input as the number of vector components of its output, its determinant is referred to as the Jacobian determinant***. Both the matrix and (if applicable) the determinant are often referred to simply as the Jacobian in literature. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant))_
```

[![Hessian matrix for Newton Method](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/229297019-4583e9a7-273d-4489-ab87-37c88be16adb.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix)

By this exponentiation zones we will get multiple layers of primes density. So we need to get in to the patterns of the above hexagonal forms through _[deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)_.

## Exponentiation patterns

Here we adopt an analysis of variance called _N/P-Integration_ that was applied to find the best set of environmental variables that describe the density out of distance matrices.

```note
With collaborators, we regularly work on projects where we want to understand the taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial community in the context of metadata often recorded under specific hypotheses. Integrating (***N-/P- integration***; see figure below) these datasets require a fair deal of multivariate statistical analysis for which I have shared the [code](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological.html) on this website. _([Umer.Ijaz](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/#intro))_
```

[![N-/P- integration](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/661ff31c-1224-40e6-b4d8-968c0bb1d396)](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/#intro)

We found also a useful method called ***Square of Nine*** which was developed by _[WD Gann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Delbert_Gann)_ to analyze stock market behaviour base on astrological pattern.

```note
He designed a new approach to predicting market behavior using several disciplines, ***including geometry, astrology, astronomy, and ancient mathematics***. They say that not long before his death, Gann developed a unique trading system. ***However, he preferred not to make his invention public or share it with anyone***. _([PipBear](https://pipbear.com/price-action-pattern/gann-square-of-9/))_
```

[![The Square of 9](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/e21c7bfc-0d91-4bc6-8a28-e61a2cdadece)](https://pipbear.com/price-action-pattern/gann-square-of-9/)

By parsering 168 primes of 1000 id's across `π(π(100 x 100)) - 1 = 200` then the (Δ1) would be _[initiated](https://eq19.github.io/init.js)_. As you may guess they will slightly forms the ***hexagonal patterns***.

```note
The Hexagon chart begins with a 0 in the center, surrounded by the numbers 1 through 6. ***Each additional layer adds 6 more numbers as we move out, and these numbers are arranged into a Hexagon formation***. This is pretty much as far as Gann went in his descriptions. He basically said, "This works, but you have to figure out how."One method that I've found that works well on ***all these kinds of charts is plotting planetary longitude values on them, and looking for patterns***. On the chart above, each dot represents the location of a particular planet. The red one at the bottom is the Sun, and up from it is Mars. These are marked on the chart. Notice that the Sun and Mars are connected along a pink line running through the center of the chart. The idea is that when two planets line up along a similar line, we have a signal event similar to a conjunction in the sky. ***Any market vibrating to the Hexagon arrangement should show some kind of response to this situation***. _([Wave59](https://www.wave59.com/showcase/121304.asp))_

We are focusing to MEC30 so we end up this exponentiation by the famous quote from _WD Gann_ himself stating an important changes by certain ***repetition of 30***.

```tip
W.D. Gann: “Stocks make important changes in trend every ***30, 60, 120, 150, 210, 240, 300, 330, 360*** days or degrees from any important top or bottom.”
```

***In line with 168 there is 330 located of 10th layer***. Since the base unit of 30 repeats it self on the center then this `11 x 30 = 330` is pushed to the `10 + 1 = 11th layer`. 

This eleven (11) will continue to be discussed on _[identition zone](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)_.

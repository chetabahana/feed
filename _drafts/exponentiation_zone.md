# Exponentiation Zones (31-36)

Exponentiation is an operation involving two numbers, the base and the exponent or power. Exponentiation is written as ***b<sup>n</sup>***, where ***b*** is the base and ***n*** is the power.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

Exponentiation Zones allows multiple layers on representing _[recursive residues](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07561)_ of the operands, thus promising large gain to the conventional arithmetic expression

## Basic Transformation

The first appearance of ***e*** in a printed publication was in Euler's [Mechanica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanica) (1736). It is unknown why Euler chose the letter e. 

```note
[Leonhard Euler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) started to use ***the letter e*** for the constant in 1727 or 1728, in an unpublished paper on explosive forces in cannons, and in a letter to [Christian Goldbach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Goldbach) on 25 November 1731. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)))_
```

[![Letter e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/262249679-b5d6fc1a-6e42-4775-b09d-965ddd046171.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant))

This exponentiation takes important roles since by the _[multiplication zones](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)_ the MEC30 forms a matrix of  `8 x 8 = 64 = 8²` where the power of 2 stands as exponent

```note
During the last few years of the 12th century, ***Fibonacci*** undertook a series of travels around the Mediterranean. At this time, the world’s most prominent mathematicians were Arabs, and he spent much time studying with them. His work, whose title translates as the Book of Calculation, was extremely influential in that ***it popularized the use of the Arabic numerals in Europe***, thereby revolutionizing arithmetic and allowing scientific experiment and discovery to progress more quickly. _([Famous Mathematicians](https://famous-mathematicians.org/leonardo-pisano-bigollo/))_
```

[![MEC30 Square](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/262213707-63aa0a64-cf7d-4fb7-9f1a-f3d1ba805643.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)

Since the first member is 30 then the form is initiated by a matrix of `5 x 6 = 30` which has to be transformed first to `6 x 6 = 36 = 6²` prior to the above MEC30's square. 

```note
A square system of coupled nonlinear equations can be solved iteratively by Newton's method. This method uses the Jacobian matrix of the system of equations. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant))_
```

So basically  there is a basic transformation between ***[addition](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)*** of `3 + 4 = 7` in to their ***[multiplication](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/)*** of `3 x 4 = 12` while the 7 vs 12 will be treated as ***exponentiation***.

```note
In the standard version of gematria, each letter is given a numerical value between 1 and 400, as shown in the following table. In the Mispar gadol variation, the five final letters are given their own values, ranging from 500 to 900. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria))_

It has zero spin, even (positive) parity, no electric charge, and no colour charge, and it couples to (interacts with) mass.

## Space Expansion

Using this concept we are going to stimulate a model of the 11 dimensions throug the rank of their partition using github organizations of 13 repositories each.

```tip
Each of the user profiles will have ***seven (7) user repositories*** consist of one (1) main of [`github.io`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and six (6) user pinned repositories. Meanwhile each of organizations will have one (1) profile of [`.github`](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-public-organization-profile-readme) repository and ***thirteen (13) organization repositories*** consist of one (1) main of [`github.io`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), and twelve (12) pinned repositories under [`member and public view`](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#pinning-repositories-to-your-organizations-profile) of six (6) repositories each.
```

***[®main](https://github.com/eq19) + [®wiki](https://gist.github.com/eq19) + [®orgs](https://github.com/settings/organizations) = 7 + (7+11) + (11x13) = 7 + 18 + 143 = 24 x 7 = 168 = π(1000)***

{% for item in site.data.orgs %}
  1. {{ item.name | jsonify }}
     - {{ item.key1 | jsonify }}
     - {{ item.key2 | jsonify }}
{% endfor %}

The _[Root Function](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#root-functions)_ of ***13 repositories*** per each of organization above is not arranged to directly follow the _[partition function](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#partition-function)_ but through _[the 18 gists](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_ via their _[.github profiles](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-public-organization-profile-readme)_.

```note
The four faces of our pyramid additively cascade ***32 four-times triangular numbers*** (Note that 4 x 32 = 128 = the perimeter of the square base which has an area of ***32^2 = 1024 = 2^10***). These include Fibo1-3 equivalent 112 (rooted in T7 = 28; 28 x 4 = 112), which creates a pyramidion or capstone in our model, and 2112 (rooted in T32 = 528; 528 x 4 = 2112), which is the index number of ***the 1000th prime*** within our domain, and equals the total number of 'elements' used to construct the pyramid. _([PrimesDemystified](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html))_
```

***1000 x (5 + 360) days = 1000 years***

By taking the correlation of these 11 partitions with the logical sequence of numbers there would be a ***[series expansion](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#elementary-structure)***.

```note
***All of these results strongly suggest adynkras are pointing in the direction of using series expansion*** in terms of YT’s as a tool to gain the most fundamental mathematical understanding of this class of problems. _([Higher-Dimensional Supergravity - Pdf](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/12924002/ATMP-2021-0025-0006-a003.pdf))_

Both 1/89 and 1/109 have the Fibonacci sequence _[encoded in their decimal expansions](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#minor-hexagons)_ illustrates a period-24 palindromic that bring ***the powers of pi***. 

```note
Proceeding, the number line begins to coil upon itself; 20 lands on 2’s cell, 21 on 3’s cell. Prime number 23 sends the number line left to form the fourth hexagon, purple. As it is not a twin, the clockwise progression (rotation) reverses itself. Twin primes ***29 and 31 define the fifth (5th) hexagon***, cyan. Finally, 3 7, again not a twin, reverses the rotation of the system, so 47 can define the yellow hexagon _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_.
```

***19 + 18 + 102 = 37 + 102 = 139 = 34th prime = (40 - 6)the prime***

Observing more detail of the discussed scheme of 168 we will get it also when we take the 19's and 17's cell of `(31+37)+(35+65)=68+100=168`.

## Quadratic Polynomials

We therefore set them both on _[the wiki](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/wiki)_ and the 18's on _[the gist](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_. The 19's and 17's cover the 4 zones while the 18's covers the 66 items as the central base of hexagonal spins.

```tip
By our project the 18's on the gist will cover five (5) unique functions that behave as ***one (1) central plus four (4) zones***. This scheme will be implemented to all of the 168 repositories as bilateral way (***in-out***) depend on their postion on the system. So along with the gist it self then there shall be `1 + 168 = 169` units of 1685 root functions.
```

***5 + 2 x 5 x 168 = 5 + 1680 = 1685 root functions***

![](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/36441664/269950673-502f174e-fadc-4ad9-afbc-184ae03cde5a.jpg)

By the spin above you can see that the 4 zones of these `19's to 17's` are representing the rotation `1 to 5`. Such of formation can be seen on _[Ulam Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral)_ as below.

```note
The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanisław Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific American a short time later.
```

[![ulam spiral](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/274058089-72669dae-9f66-4953-bb5b-670aac2090f2.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral)

By MEC30 we will also discuss the relation of these 4 zones with high density of 40 primes where 60 number is folded. So by the module 6 it will always return to the beginning position within [`60+40=100 nodes`](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#the-power-of-168-vs-618) per layer.

```note
Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines ***is not unexpected***, as lines in ***the spiral correspond to quadratic polynomials***, and certain such polynomials, such as Euler's prime-generating polynomial x²-x+41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers. Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with **major unsolved problems** in number theory such as Landau's problems _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral))_.
```

[![prime Sacks_spiral](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/229820606-b2bbd7fb-3300-4507-8080-fb27ed6fd512.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#streching-structure)

This density will bring the _[D3-Brane](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_ where the lexer is being assigned per MEC30. Base on the its spin as shown in the above picture this lexer is assigned by [`Id: 33`](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#euler-partition).

## Truncated Perturbation

We found also a useful method called ***Square of Nine*** which was developed by _[WD Gann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Delbert_Gann)_ to analyze stock market behaviour base on astrological pattern.

```note
He designed a new approach to predicting market behavior using several disciplines, ***including geometry, astrology, astronomy, and ancient mathematics***. They say that not long before his death, Gann developed a unique trading system. ***However, he preferred not to make his invention public or share it with anyone***. _([PipBear](https://pipbear.com/price-action-pattern/gann-square-of-9/))_
```

[![The Square of 9](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/8466209/258702885-e21c7bfc-0d91-4bc6-8a28-e61a2cdadece.png)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi)

By parsering 168 primes of 1000 id's across `π(π(100 x 100)) - 1 = 200` then the (Δ1) would be _[initiated](https://eq19.github.io/init.js)_. As you may guess they will slightly forms the ***hexagonal patterns***.

```note
The Hexagon chart begins with a 0 in the center, surrounded by the numbers 1 through 6. ***Each additional layer adds 6 more numbers as we move out, and these numbers are arranged into a Hexagon formation***. This is pretty much as far as Gann went in his descriptions. He basically said, "This works, but you have to figure out how."One method that I've found that works well on ***all these kinds of charts is plotting planetary longitude values on them, and looking for patterns***. On the chart above, each dot represents the location of a particular planet. The red one at the bottom is the Sun, and up from it is Mars. These are marked on the chart. Notice that the Sun and Mars are connected along a pink line running through the center of the chart. The idea is that when two planets line up along a similar line, we have a signal event similar to a conjunction in the sky. ***Any market vibrating to the Hexagon arrangement should show some kind of response to this situation***. _([Wave59](https://www.wave59.com/showcase/121304.asp))_
```

[![Patterns of planetary longitude](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/c6c0f731-a482-40c0-8447-b959fbb9d06a)](https://www.wave59.com/showcase/121304.asp)

We are focusing to MEC30 so we end up this exponentiation by the famous quote from _WD Gann_ himself stating an important changes by certain ***repetition of 30***.

```tip
W.D. Gann: “Stocks make important changes in trend every ***30, 60, 120, 150, 210, 240, 300, 330, 360*** days or degrees from any important top or bottom.”
```

***In line with 168 there is 330 located of 10th layer***. Since the base unit of 30 repeats it self on the center then this `11 x 30 = 330` is pushed to the `10 + 1 = 11th layer`. 

This eleven (11) will continue to be discussed on _[identition zone](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)_.

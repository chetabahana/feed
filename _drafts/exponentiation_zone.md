# Exponentiation Zones (31-36)

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

## Background of exponentiation

Exponentiation is an operation involving two numbers, the base and the exponent or power. Exponentiation is written as ***b<sup>n</sup>***, where ***b*** is the base and ***n*** is the power.

```note
[Leonhard Euler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) started to use ***the letter e*** for the constant in 1727 or 1728, in an unpublished paper on explosive forces in cannons, and in a letter to [Christian Goldbach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Goldbach) on 25 November 1731. The first appearance of e in a printed publication was in Euler's [Mechanica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanica) (1736). It is unknown why Euler chose the letter e. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)))_
```

[![Letter e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/262249679-b5d6fc1a-6e42-4775-b09d-965ddd046171.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant))

This exponentiation takes important roles since by the _[multiplication zones](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)_ the MEC30 forms a matrix of  `8 x 8 = 64 = 8²` where the power of 2 stands as exponent

[![MEC30 Square](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/262213707-63aa0a64-cf7d-4fb7-9f1a-f3d1ba805643.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)

Since the first member is 30 then the form is initiated by a matrix of `5 x 6 = 30` which has to be transformed first to `6 x 6 = 36 = 6²` prior to the above MEC30's square.

By the item factorization we will need to use _[the logarithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm)_ which is the [inverse function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function) to [exponentiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation). We end up by the tabulation as below.

```tip
In the standard (Mispar hechrechi) version of gematria, each letter is given a numerical value between 1 and 400, as shown in the following table. In the Mispar gadol variation, the five final letters are given their own values, ranging from 500 to 900.
```

***Δ prime = 114th prime - 19 = (6 x 19)th prime - 19 = 619 - 19 = 600***

You may see this scheme is build by 3 (three) layers where the next layer will continue the primes object by carrying the tensor of prime [31 and 71](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#primes-platform) of previous layer.

[![recycle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/241399304-54abb818-2af1-4d9f-80dc-0b1237b88be4.png)](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/18)

Since the _modulo 6_ is occured all over the spin then we have defined that this 4 zones should stand as ***default configuration*** as you can see on the left sidebar. 

[![main spin](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/d29de686-b885-40aa-a585-0665a56cca9a)](https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity)

The sum of `31 + 71 = 102`. Meanwhile they are formed by 66 items. Let's combine them all then we will get 168 which is the total primes out of 1000.

### Hexagonal formation

Observing more detail of the discussed scheme of 168 we will get it also when we take the 19's and 17's cell of `(31+37)+(35+65)=68+100=168`.

```note
Proceeding, the number line begins to coil upon itself; 20 lands on 2’s cell, 21 on 3’s cell. Prime number 23 sends the number line left to form the fourth hexagon, purple. As it is not a twin, the clockwise progression (rotation) reverses itself. Twin primes ***29 and 31 define the fifth hexagon***, cyan. Finally, 37, again not a twin, reverses the rotation of the system, so 47 can define the yellow hexagon _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_.
```

[![Defining the Prime Hexagon](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/71ba3b6c-54aa-4587-af5f-abd2af4b968a)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

We therefore set them both on _[the wiki](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/wiki)_ and the 18's on _[the gist](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_. The 19's and 17's cover the 4 zones while the 18's covers the 66 items as the central base of hexagonal spins.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/226644534-00cf4fe3-04f9-4b28-8a8b-674bcf4bd585.png)

By the spin above you can see that the 4 zones of these `19's to 17's` are representing the rotation `1 to 5`. Such of formation can be seen on _Ulam Spiral_ as below.

```tip
The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanisław Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific American a short time later.
```

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Hexgrid_prime_number_spiral.svg)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Hexgrid_prime_number_spiral.svg)

By MEC30 we will also discuss the relation of these 4 zones with high density of 40 primes where 60 number is folded. So by the module 6 it will always return to the beginning position within [`60+40=100 nodes`](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#the-power-of-168-vs-618) per layer.

```note
Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines ***is not unexpected***, as lines in ***the spiral correspond to quadratic polynomials***, and certain such polynomials, such as Euler's prime-generating polynomial x²-x+41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers. Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with **major unsolved problems** in number theory such as Landau's problems _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral))_.
```

[![prime Sacks_spiral](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/229820606-b2bbd7fb-3300-4507-8080-fb27ed6fd512.png)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Sacks_spiral.svg/120px-Sacks_spiral.svg.png)

Since the _modulo 6_ is occured all over the spin then we have defined that this 4 zones should stand as ***default configuration*** as you can see on the left sidebar. 

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/230746478-0146e88e-22ba-4f1b-abf2-c5226c1a56ca.png)

By this point we come to the position where the lexer is being assigned per MEC30. Base on the its spin as shown in the above picture this lexer is assigned by [`Id: 33`](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#euler-partition).

## Parsering Structure

You may see that the spins are going backward starting with `Id: 31`. This is identical with the rotation curve of energy distribution by the MEC30.

```note
The position 19 in the second term gives a redundant value of the template 7 of 7 × 7 = 49. The opposite prime position of the 19 is 11. So in this second term the 11th-prime number 31 is now forced to determine ***a new axis-symmetrical zero position***. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en))_ 
```

***37 + 12 = 61 - 12 = 49 = 7 x 7 = d(13)***

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74591945-2b75cb80-504f-11ea-85dd-14d0a803ee6b.png)

Below is the scheme showing a parsering result by repeating the positions in the next step. These positions: `1 7 11 13 17 19 23 29` refer as ***the basic system of MEC30***.

```note
Because the value 30 is the first (common) product of the first 3 primes. ***And this 30th order repeats itself to infinity. Even in the first 30s system, therefore, the positions are fixed in which the number information positions itself to infinity***. We call it the first member of the MEC 30. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en))_ 
```

[![parsering](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74591731-f5cfe300-504c-11ea-9e04-d814c57aa969.png)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#euler-partition)

As you can see on the left sidebar (dekstop mode) a total of 102 items will be reached by the end of `Id: 35`. So when they transfered to `Id: 36` it will cover [`11 x 6 = 66 items`](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/) thus the total will be `102 + 66 = 168`

***168 + 329 + 289 - 619 - 30 - 30 - 5 = 786 - 619 - 65 = 102***

[![exponentiation zones](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/200024664-afc433a0-5f7f-4ec1-9bfc-77d672817fed.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

Using the javascript library from _[Chevotrain](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-minor-hexagons)_ and data parser from _[Jekyll/Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/)_ finally we found the correlation between the lexer and parser.

[![Parsering](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/50fbc0a0-7441-4800-97aa-265b0dfd2ac2)](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#exponentiation-zones-31-36)

The implementation from addition folder 1 will be exposed by the exponentiation folder 7 meanwhile the folder 12 of multiplication goes to identition zone of 11 folders.

So they are `4 folders (1, 7, 11, 12)` remain inviolable by the gist.

## Exponentiation patterns

By this exponentiation zones we will get multiple layers of primes density. So we need to get in to the patterns of the above hexagonal forms through _[deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)_.

```note
It's possible to build a _[Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix)_ for a _[Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization)_ step using the Jacobian method. ***You would first flatten out its axes into a matrix, and flatten out the gradient into a vector.*** _([Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/advanced_autodiff#batch_jacobian))_
```

[![Tensorflow - Batch Jacobian](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/128624639-b5d8c73f-79af-4433-8b7b-28a35e331d21.png)](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/advanced_autodiff#batch_jacobian)

When the subclasses of partitions are flatten out into a matrix, you want to take the Jacobian of each of a stack of targets with respect to a stack of sources, where the Jacobians for each target-source pair are independent.

```note
In vector calculus, the Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function of several variables is the matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives. ***When this matrix is square, that is, when the function takes the same number of variables as input as the number of vector components of its output, its determinant is referred to as the Jacobian determinant***. Both the matrix and (if applicable) the determinant are often referred to simply as the Jacobian in literature. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant))_
```

[![Hessian matrix for Newton Method](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/229297019-4583e9a7-273d-4489-ab87-37c88be16adb.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix)

Here we adopt an analysis of variance called _N/P-Integration_ that was applied to find the best set of environmental variables that describe the density out of distance matrices.

```tip
With collaborators, we regularly work on projects where we want to understand the taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial community in the context of metadata often recorded under specific hypotheses. Integrating (***N-/P- integration***; see figure below) these datasets require a fair deal of multivariate statistical analysis for which I have shared the [code](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological.html) on this website. _([Umer.Ijaz](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/#intro))_
```

[![N-/P- integration](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/661ff31c-1224-40e6-b4d8-968c0bb1d396)](https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/#intro)

We found also a useful method called ***Square of Nine*** which was developed by _[WD Gann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Delbert_Gann)_ to analyze stock market behaviour base on astrological pattern.

```note
He designed a new approach to predicting market behavior using several disciplines, ***including geometry, astrology, astronomy, and ancient mathematics***. They say that not long before his death, Gann developed a unique trading system. ***However, he preferred not to make his invention public or share it with anyone***. _([PipBear](https://pipbear.com/price-action-pattern/gann-square-of-9/))_
```

[![The Square of 9](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/e21c7bfc-0d91-4bc6-8a28-e61a2cdadece)](https://pipbear.com/price-action-pattern/gann-square-of-9/)

By parsering 168 primes of 1000 id's across `π(π(100 x 100)) - 1 = 200` then the (Δ1) would be _[initiated](https://eq19.github.io/init.js)_. As you may guess they will slightly forms the ***hexagonal patterns***.

```note
The Hexagon chart begins with a 0 in the center, surrounded by the numbers 1 through 6. ***Each additional layer adds 6 more numbers as we move out, and these numbers are arranged into a Hexagon formation***. This is pretty much as far as Gann went in his descriptions. He basically said, "This works, but you have to figure out how."One method that I've found that works well on ***all these kinds of charts is plotting planetary longitude values on them, and looking for patterns***. On the chart above, each dot represents the location of a particular planet. The red one at the bottom is the Sun, and up from it is Mars. These are marked on the chart. Notice that the Sun and Mars are connected along a pink line running through the center of the chart. The idea is that when two planets line up along a similar line, we have a signal event similar to a conjunction in the sky. ***Any market vibrating to the Hexagon arrangement should show some kind of response to this situation***. _([Wave59](https://www.wave59.com/showcase/121304.asp))_
```

[![Patterns of planetary longitude](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/c6c0f731-a482-40c0-8447-b959fbb9d06a)](https://www.wave59.com/showcase/121304.asp)

We are focusing to MEC30 so we end up this exponentiation by the famous quote from _WD Gann_ himself stating an important changes by certain ***repetition of 30***.

```tip
W.D. Gann: “Stocks make important changes in trend every ***30, 60, 120, 150, 210, 240, 300, 330, 360*** days or degrees from any important top or bottom.”
```

[![WD Gann - Hexagonal Chart](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/defe3aa5-ab70-4fd6-9412-b19c21a4ffaf)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)

***In line with 168 there is 330 located of 10th layer***. Since the base unit of 30 repeats it self on the center then this `11 x 30 = 330` is pushed to the `10 + 1 = 11th layer`. 

This eleven (11) will continue to be discussed on _[identition zone](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)_.

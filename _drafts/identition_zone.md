# Identition Zones (37-102)

By this image you would see how the exponentiation zones should actually work on our solar system. But there is still not enough. Nowadays there are many scientists come in to the conclusion that there should be ***extra dimensions*** involved.

[![Solar Ststem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/223703153-6ea330bf-92e8-433b-9ebe-660430a87a29.gif)](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#subclasses-of-partition)

The extra dimensions play a crucial role in string theory and typically it would take a very complicated form. It is not even showed in the function of _[Euler Identity](https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity)_ which brings the three (3) operations of ***addition, multiplication*** and ***exponentiation***.

```note
Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in **11 dimensions** known as M-theory _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory))_.
```

![M-theory](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/38b6bb71-6e4b-4020-aa59-03d83873ffc5)

In order to propagate through space and interact we shall attemp it using [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) One must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments so it would become irrational partitions.

Below is a model of E11 (shown by 11 dimensions). Its absolute dimensions represent all related key knowledges of modern physics. Moreover a model that represents [Quark-Gluon Plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma), with fundamental forces in the early stage after Big Bang.

```tip
The concept of eleven dimensions is a theoretical one in physics and cosmology, specifically in the realm of string theory and M-theory. These theories propose that our observable universe is made up of 11 dimensions, rather than the traditional three dimensions of length, width, and height, and the fourth dimension of time. The additional dimensions are thought to be compactified or curled up, meaning that they are not directly observable by us in our everyday experience.As for the cosmic philosophy, it is important to note that these theories are still considered speculative and have not been proven through experimental evidence. However, they do offer a new perspective on the nature of our universe and the fundamental forces that govern it. Some scientists and philosophers argue that these theories may provide new insights into the origins of the universe and the nature of reality itself. Ultimately, the concept of eleven dimensions is a fascinating area of study that continues to inspire new research and discoveries in the field of physics and cosmology. _(ChatGPT)_

Despite the theories are still considered speculative, we are going to take them in to our main topics. That is the reason why we bring this identition zones of 11 dimensions. .

Here we implement a method called the rank of a partition where the rank of a partition of a positive integer is a certain integer  associated with the partition.

## Partition function

In mathematics, the rank of a partition is the number obtained by subtracting the number of parts in the partition from the largest part in the partition.
 
```note
The concept was introduced by [Freeman Dyson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson) in a paper published in the journal [Eureka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(University_of_Cambridge_magazine)). It was [presented](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_partition#cite_note-Dyson-1) in the context of a study of certain [congruence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_relation) properties of the [partition function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)) discovered by the Indian mathematical genius [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_partition))_
```

[![Rank_of_a_partition](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/36441664/0d9e8f5e-5ba6-4e5d-98d3-d9fc73d2f01f)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_partition)

Further observation on these partitions with the logical sequence of numbers we finaly found a ***[linkage to the powers of 10](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-minor-hexagons)***. This behaviour brings us to a suggestion that the dimension in string theory are linked with the prime distribution.

```note
It turns out that quantum string theory always destroys the symmetries of the classical string theory, **except in one special case: when the number of dimensions is 10**. That's why string theory works only in 10 dimensions _([Physicsforums](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-is-it-necessary-to-have-11-dimensions-in-m-theory.821762/))_.
```

As conclusion the behaviour of this 7 is happen between the sequence of 30 and 36 while the 12 is happen between the sequence of 36 and 102.

```note
We've seen how it [Euler's identity] can easily be deduced from results of Johann Bernoulli and Roger Cotes, but that neither of them seem to have done so. Even Euler does not seem to have written it down explicitly â€“ and certainly it doesn't appear in any of his publications â€“ though he must surely have realized that it follows immediately from his identity [i.e. [Euler's formula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula)], e^ix = cos x + i sin x. ***Moreover, it seems to be unknown who first stated the result explicitlyâ€¦*** _([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity))_
```

When the seven (7) and eleven (11) are combined as eighteen (18) then by the prime hexagon âˆ†1 is recycled as nineteen (19) and generate ***114 partitions***. 

```tip
By this tabulation you may see that all the numbers between 37 and 102 are located within ***11 columns***. This 11 is reflected to the extra dimensions. However by MEC30 the number 11 is bonding with 19 so it would go to another cycles starting with ***the 26th dimension*** which will bring them to the 30. And by the MEC30 this 30th order ***[repeats itself](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)*** to infinity. Even in the first 30s system.

By the above tabulation, here you can see that _[the layout](https://github.com/eq19/feed/tree/v2/_layouts)_ of our home page refers to the configuration of âˆ†1 i.e. id: 1-18, id: 19-30, id: 31-36, and id: 37-102.

## Euler partition

By _[The Î”(19 vs 18) Scenario](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef)_ those three are exactly landed in the ***0's cell*** out of Î”18. See that the sum of 30 and 36 is 66 while the difference between 36 and 102 is also 66.

***0 + 30 + 36 + 102 = 168 = Ï€(1000)***

The function that appears in the denominator is _[Partition Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)#Generating_function)_. The equality between the product on the first line and the formulas ***in the third and fourth lines*** is _[Euler's pentagonal number theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number_theorem)_ where `p(33) = 10143` landed exactly by `n - 7`.

Here we can see that the transformation from 7 to 12 is actually started from the prime 13. So the power of 7 is transfered to 77 by the prime pair 11 and 13. 

```note
We call this double strand a convolution, which results in an opposite arrangement. It represents the natural vibration, thus also the redundant vibrations in the energy transfer. In the 6 For example, in the graph, the even number 60 is folded. At folding of the even number 60 6 result in ***8 prime pairs***. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en))_
```

***89^2 - 1 = 7920 = 22 x 360 = 66 x 120 = (168 - 102) x 120***

As explicitly indicated by `n - 7` within identition zones this `p(33)` behave reversal to the _[exponentiation zones](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#exponentiation-zones-31-36)_ so it would stand as [`Ï€(Ï€(Ï€(1000th prime)))+1`](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs). By the prime pair 11 and 13 the nodes is converted from 7 to 77 which is 7 times 11.

```note
Note that when 77 contains 'Lucky 7 and 11' as prime factors it is also the product of the middle two numbers of this sequence (11*7 = 77). _([Prime Curios!](https://t5k.org/curios/page.php/77.html))_

By [the next term](https://www.eq19.com/maps/) there are fractions within these 1000 primes which end up with 168 identities of the same structure as the seven (7) pÃ rtitions of _[addition zones](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)_.

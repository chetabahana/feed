# Identition Zones (37-102)

Identition is defined for a complex operation by extending one of the definitions of the exponential function from real exponents to complex exponents.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

This identition zones stands as one of the solution to deal with the residual primes that is occured in the exponentation zones to become compactifiable within _[the base unit](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#addition-zones-1-18)_.

## Extra dimensions

By this image you would see how the exponentiation zones should actually work on our solar system. But there is still not enough.

```note
Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in **11 dimensions** known as M-theory _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory))_.
```

[![Solar Ststem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/223703153-6ea330bf-92e8-433b-9ebe-660430a87a29.gif)](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#subclasses-of-partition)

Nowadays there are many scientists come in to the conclusion that there should be ***extra dimensions*** involved and typically it would take a very complicated form.

5. ***Alternate world*** (we could measure similarities and differences of what might have been).
6. ***A plane of possible worlds*** that start with the same conditions (example: the Big Bang). Theoretically, if you were to master the sixth and seventh dimensions, you could travel through time.
7. ***Access to different worlds*** with different initial conditions. Here, everything would have happened differently, including the beginning conditions (one universe started with the Big Bang, another with the Oscillating Universe theory).
8. This dimension is similar to the seventh. There are ***[multiple universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#M-theory)*** that all started differently and histories that branch out infinitely.
9. Here, we can compare ***all the could-have-been universes***, each with a possibly different set of laws of physics.
10. Kinda like ***an extra room to accommodate ALL the theories***. In additions, some physicists believe that at the instant of the Big Bang, the universe(s) was fully 10 dimensional.

In order to propagate through space and how they interact with each other we shall attemp it using [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) that bring the concept of ***eleven (11) dimensions***.

## String Theory

In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by ***one-dimensional objects*** called strings.

```note
***It is argued, among other things, that eleven-dimensional supergravity arises as a low energy limit of the ten-dimensional Type IIA superstring***, and that a recently conjectured duality between the heterotic string and Type IIA superstrings controls the strong coupling dynamics of the heterotic string in five, six, and seven dimensions and implies S-duality for both heterotic and Type II strings. _([String Theory - Pdf](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/12640756/String_theory.pdf))_
```

The strong coupling dynamics of string theories in dimension d â©¾ 4 are studied. Some theories state that light is nothing but ripples of vibrations in the fifth dimension.

```tip
The concept of eleven dimensions is a theoretical one in physics and cosmology, specifically in the realm of string theory and M-theory. ***These theories propose that our observable universe is made up of 11 dimensions, rather than the traditional three dimensions of length, width, and height, and the fourth dimension of time***. The additional dimensions are thought to be compactified or curled up, meaning that they are not directly observable by us in our everyday experience. ***As for the cosmic philosophy, it is important to note that these theories are still considered speculative and have not been proven through experimental evidence***. However, they do offer a new perspective on the nature of our universe and the fundamental forces that govern it. Some scientists and philosophers argue that these theories may provide new insights into the origins of the universe and the nature of reality itself. Ultimately, the concept of eleven dimensions is a fascinating area of study that continues to inspire new research and discoveries in the field of physics and cosmology. _(ChatGPT)_
```

![M-theory](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/38b6bb71-6e4b-4020-aa59-03d83873ffc5)

Our physical space is observed to have only three large dimensions and taken together with time as the fourth dimension, a physical theory must take this into account. 

```note
Nothing prevents a theory from including more than 4 dimensions. In the case of string theory, consistency requires spacetime to have 10, 11 or 26 dimensions. ***The conflict between observation and theory is resolved by making the unobserved dimensions compactified***. _([Astrophysics Research](https://astrophysicsblogs.blogspot.com/2008/01/superstring-theory_03.html))_

Here we implement a method called the rank of a partition where the rank of a partition of a positive integer is a certain integer associated with the partition.

## Partition function

In mathematics, the rank of a partition is the number obtained by subtracting the number of parts in the partition from the largest part in the partition.
 
```note
The concept was introduced by [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson)in a paper published in the journal [Eureka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(University_of_Cambridge_magazine)). It was [presented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_partition#cite_note-Dyson-1) in the context of a study of certain [congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_relation) properties of the [partition function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)) discovered by the Indian mathematical genius [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_partition))_
```

[![Rank_of_a_partition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/227838045-3ddd5238-7beb-4023-affa-c61a054afd2b.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_partition)

In quantum field theory, [partition functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(quantum_field_theory)) are generating functionals for correlation functions, making them key objects of study in the path integral formalism. 

```note
As usual, the images ***on the left are snapshots of the particles at different times. Those times correspond to the grey slices in the space-time diagram on the right***. You can see the specific interaction points in the space-time diagram, where the blue particle is emitted and then absorbed by the red particles. Those points will be important later, as we compare this to the situation in ***string theory***. _([Slimy.com](http://www.slimy.com/~steuard/research/StringIntro/slide13.html))_
```

[![Feynman diagrams](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/36441664/269164028-d5a17004-fbf2-494a-a2f0-f0bb1674c938.jpg)](http://www.slimy.com/~steuard/research/StringIntro/slide13.html)

One must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments so one of solution would be [truncated approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07678).

```note
***They are the imaginary time versions of statistical mechanics partition functions, giving rise to a close connection between these two areas of physics***. Partition functions can rarely be solved for exactly, although free theories do admit such solutions. Instead, a _[perturbative approach](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76996904.pdf)_ is usually implemented, this being equivalent to summing over Feynman diagrams. _([Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Partition_function_%28quantum_field_theory%29))_
```

Geometrically flat space has three dimensions and is consistent with Euclidean space. However, spacetime has four dimensions; _[it is not flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe)_ according to Einsten's theory.

```note
It turns out that quantum string theory always destroys the symmetries of classical string theory, **except in one special case: when the number of dimensions is 10**. That's why string theory works only in 10 dimensions _([Physicsforums](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-is-it-necessary-to-have-11-dimensions-in-m-theory.821762/))_.
```

Below is a model of E11 (shown by 11 dimensions). Its absolute dimensions represent all related key knowledges of modern physics. 

```note
In quantum mechanics, and in particular in atomic and molecular physics, within the Hartreeâ€“Fock theory, the atomic and molecular orbitals can be defined by the eigenvectors of the Fock operator. The corresponding _[eigenvalues](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#streaching-structure)_ are interpreted as ionization potentials via Koopmans' theorem. In this case, the term eigenvector is used in a somewhat more general meaning, since the Fock operator is explicitly dependent on the orbitals and their eigenvalues. Thus, if one wants to underline this aspect, one speaks of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Such equations are usually solved by an iteration procedure, called in this case ***self-consistent field method***.
```

```note
The four faces of our pyramid additively cascade ***32 four-times triangular numbers*** (Note that 4 x 32 = 128 = the perimeter of the square base which has an area of ***32^2 = 1024 = 2^10***). These include Fibo1-3 equivalent 112 (rooted in T7 = 28; 28 x 4 = 112), which creates a pyramidion or capstone in our model, and 2112 (rooted in T32 = 528; 528 x 4 = 2112), which is the index number of ***the 1000th prime*** within our domain, and equals the total number of 'elements' used to construct the pyramid. _([PrimesDemystified](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html))_

The symmetry of this supergravity theory is given by the supergroup OSp(1\32) which gives the subgroups O(1) for the bosonic and Sp(32) for the fermion. 

```note
This is because ***[spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor) need 32 components in 11 dimensions. 11D supergravity can be compactified down to 4 dimensions*** which then has OSp(8\4) symmetry. (We still have 8 Ã— 4 = 32 so there are still the same number of components.) Spinors need 4 components in 4 dimensions. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-dimensional_supergravity#The_mathematics))_
```

[![spinor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/273259221-4ba9147b-675a-4656-9e62-30b65e7783fe.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor)

By taking the correlation of these 11 partitions with the logical sequence of numbers there would be a ***[linkage to the powers of 10](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-minor-hexagons)***.

```note
The first 1000 prime numbers are silently screaming: "Pay attention to us, for we hold the secret to the distribution of all primes!"

Both 1/89 and 1/109 have the Fibonacci sequence in their decimal expansions illustrates a period-24 palindromic that bring ***the powers of pi***. 

## The powers of pi

This study cascade culminating in the Fibonacci digital root sequence (also period-24).  So by simple words this 11 dimensions brings us back to the _[hexagonal formation](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#root-functions)_. 

```note
The mathematically significant Fibonacci sequence defines a set of ratios known as _[Fibonacci retracements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_retracement)_ which can be used to determine probable ***[entry and exit points](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)*** for the equities when paired with additional momentum. The Fibonacci retracement levels are 0.236, 0.382, ***0.618, and 0.786***. While not officially a Fibonacci ratio, 0.5 is also commonly referenced. _([Golden Ratio - Articles](https://www.fnb.co.za/blog/investments/articles/FibonacciandtheGoldenRatio/))_
```

***786 - 618 = 168 = Ï€(1000)***

[![entry and exit point](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/225589915-8f7690c8-4c17-4232-be51-63e79efb2c51.png)](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)

Both scheme are carrying a correlation between two (2) number of 89 and 109 which provide the bilateral of 12 to the 24 cells of prime hexagon.

```note
In the matrix pictured below, we list the first 24 elements of our domain, take their squares, calculate the modulo 90 congruence and digital roots of each square, and display the digital root factorization dyad for each square (and map their ***collective bilateral 9 sum symmetry***). _([PrimesDemystified](https://primesdemystified.com/))_

Further observation we came to the conclusion that the behaviour of both scheme goes to seven (7) major partitions which is happen between the sequence of ***[30 to 36](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#self-repetition)*** while the twelve (12) is happen between the sequence of 36 to 102.

```tip
This behaviour finaly brings us to a suggestion that the dimension in string theory are linked with ***the prime distribution level*** as indicated by the self repetition on MEC30.
```

***109 = 29th prime = (10th prime)th prime***

[![Euler's identity](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/bde2248a-2feb-4c4b-85fe-f75de640775d)](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#self-repetition)

So the 36 should behave as a central. Therefore the total files that inherited from this scheme will be `1 + 7 + 29 = 37` including [one (1) main page](https://www.eq19.com). 

This scheme will be organized via the 
_[Root Functions](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#root-functions)_ of each repositories.

## Î”(19 vs 18) Scenario

By our project, these 37 files are located within _[the wiki of main repository](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/wiki)_ and organized by [the 18's structure](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs) located per the _[18 files of  project gist](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_.

```note
Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. _([GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis))_

Since we are discussing about prime distribution then this 18's structure will also cover the further scheme that is inherited from the above 37 files. We call this arrangement as ***Î”(19 vs 18) Scenario*** where the [zeta function](https://www.eq19.com/#zeta-function) stands as the basic algorithm.

```note
This web enabled demonstration shows a polar plot of ***the first 20 non-trivial Riemann zeta function zeros (including Gram points) along the critical line Zeta(1/2+it) for real values of t running from 0 to 50***. The consecutively labeled zeros have 50 red plot points between each, with zeros identified by concentric magenta rings scaled to show the relative distance between their values of t. ***Gramâ€™s law states that the curve usually crosses the real axis once between zeros***. _([TheoryOfEverything](https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2016/04/23/interactive-reimann-zeta-function-zeros-demonstration/))_

When the seven (7) and eleven (11) are _[combined as eighteen (18)](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_ then âˆ†1 by the prime hexagon is recycled as nineteen (19) and generate `37 + 77 = 114` partitions. 

```tip
By this tabulation you may see that all the numbers between 37 and 102 are located within ***11 columns*** where the 31 behave as a _[new axis](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)_. So this 11 is reflecting the ***19 to 29***. Since the 11 is bonding with 19 so it would go to another cycles starting with ***the 26th dimension*** which will bring them by ***four (4) compactification (26 to 29)*** to the 30. This 30th order ***[repeats itself](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#self-repetition)*** to infinity. Even in the first 30s system.

By the above tabulation, here you can see that _[the layout](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857)_ of our home page refers to the ***four (4) partitions*** of âˆ†1 i.e. id: 1-18, id: 19-30, id: 31-36, and id: 37-102.

```warning
Our gists would forms the _[18s structure of 11s and 7s](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_ where by the 11s, the 20th prime 71 would stand as _[eigenvalue](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#streaching-structure)_ and by the 7s the 11th prime 31 would stand as the _[new symmetical zero axis](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)_by means of MEC30. So whenever the 11s is streched to 4 dimensions it will be compacted by the 7s as _extended branes_ and finally become another level of 11 dimensions which lead to the concept of [multiple universes](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#extra-dimensions). 
```

[![Proof of Confinement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/270557989-54d6720f-fd55-44e9-a873-e11c6763bb8d.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#streaching-structure)

So the four (4) zones is actually a streaching result by means of _[eigenvector](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_. Thus it is the main reason why we see our live dimensions is four (4) instead of eleven (11).

Let's discuss how it goes by the seven (7) extra dimensions.

## Euler partition

By _[The Î”(19 vs 18) Scenario](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#%CE%B419-vs-18-scenario)_ those three are exactly landed in the ***0's cell*** out of Î”18. See that the sum of 30 and 36 is 66 while the difference between 36 and 102 is also 66.

```note
You likely noticed I began with 2 rather than 1 or 0 when I first constructed the hexagon. Why? Because they do not fit inside â€” they stick off the hexagon like a tail. Perhaps thatâ€™s where they belong. However, if one makes a significant and interesting assumption, then 1 and 0 fall in their logical locations â€“ in the 1 and 0 cells, respectively. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/0-1-and-negative-numbers/))
```

***0 + 30 + 36 + 102 = 168 = Ï€(1000)***

The function that appears in the denominator is _[Partition Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)#Generating_function)_. The equality between the product on the first line and the formulas ***in the third and fourth lines*** is _[Euler's pentagonal number theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number_theorem)_ where `p(33) = 10143` landed exactly by `n - 7`.

```note
Using Euler's method to find p(40): A ruler with plus and minus signs (grey box) is slid downwards, the relevant terms added or subtracted. The positions of the signs are given by differences of alternating natural (blue) and odd (orange) numbers.

Here we can see that the transformation from 7 to 12 is actually started from the prime 13. So the power of 7 is transfered to 77 by _[the partition level of 29 and 89](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#partition-function)_. 

```note
We call this double strand a convolution, which results in an opposite arrangement. It represents the natural vibration, thus also the redundant vibrations in the energy transfer. In the 6 For example, in the graph, the even number 60 is folded. At folding of the even number 60 6 result in ***8 prime pairs***. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en))_
```

***89^2 - 1 = 7920 = 22 x 360 = 66 x 120 = (168 - 102) x 120***

[![partition level of 29 and 89](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/244855108-b80b3c2e-1a13-4b55-828a-72ed15b448dd.png)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#partition-function)

As explicitly indicated by `n - 7` within identition zones this `p(33)` behave reversal to the _[exponentiation zones](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#exponentiation-zones-31-36)_ so it would stand as [`Ï€(Ï€(Ï€(1000th prime)))+1`](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs). By the prime pair 11 and 13 the nodes is converted from 7 to 77 which is 7 times 11.

```note

By [the next term](https://www.eq19.com/maps/) there are fractions within these 1000 primes which end up with 168 identities of the same structure as the seven (7) pÃ rtitions of _[addition zones](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)_.

The only difference is _the base unit_ of the lexer [`(Id: 33)`](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure).<br>It is now carrying the above `p(33) = 10143`.

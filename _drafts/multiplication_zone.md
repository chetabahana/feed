# Multiplication Zones (19-30)

Multiplication is the form of expression set equal to the inverse function of exponentation which stand as multiplicative identity reflects a point across the origin.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

The multiplication zones is a symmetric matrix representing the multilinear relationship of a stretching and shearing within the plane of _[the base unit](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#addition-zones-1-18)_. 

## Assigning a lexer

You may learn that sets of algebraic objects has a multilinear relationship related to a vector space called _[tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor)_.

```note
Tensors may map between different objects such as vectors, scalars, even other tensors contained in a group of _[partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory))_.
```

By prime hexagon we can see that the number seven (7), hold the power to make the prime spin remain on the track. This power is then transfered to ***twelve (12) spins***. 

```note
A Prime Hexagon is formed when integers are sequentially added to a field of tessellating equilateral triangles, where the path of the integers is changed whenever a prime number is encountered. Since prime numbers are never multiples of two or three, all numbers from "2" to infinity are confined within a ***24-cell hexagon*** _([GitHub: kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon](https://github.com/kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon#prime-hexagon))_.
```

Therefore this 12's treatment will involve at least ***11 groups of runner*** and one (1) profile of the 7's transformation. We collect them in [`11 + 7 = 18 gists`](https://gist.github.com/eq19) as below.

```tip
Gists provide a simple way to share code snippets with others. Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned. If you are signed in to GitHub when you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to your gist home page. _([GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists#about-gists))_

By the prime hexagon the 19th spin is touching back to the first node. So the workflow will be proceeded as ***bilateral way*** and twisted them by such a kind of _[double strands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair)_.

We concluded later on that this bilateral would not come to be possible if only one (1) profile is assigned. Therefore we add another profile so they would be `11 + 2 = 13's`.

These are the ones that bring [`11 + 13 = 24 cell hexagons`](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs).

## Orbital structure

The the main reason of assigning two (2) profiles instead of only one (1) is that we have to accommodate the major type of primes numbers called twin primes.

```note
This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for N to be a prime as noted, for example, by N= 6(4)+1= 25, which is clearly composite. We note that each turn of the spiral equals an increase of six units. This means that we have a mod(6) situation allowing us to write: N mod(6)=6n+1 or N mod(6)=6n-1 (equivalent to 6n+5). _([HexSpiral-Pdf](https://mae.ufl.edu/~uhk/HEX-SPIRAL-N.pdf))_
```

By our project the scheme will be treated as the sun and the moon orbit where this 31 is the maximum days of a month:

```tip
By the _[exponentiation zone](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/)_ they will end up as 7 days (***sun***) and 12 months (***moon***) while the 11 will represent the ones outside the orbit (***stars*** or ***galaxies***).

We are going to manage the relation of all the involved things in the scheme above using wiki and gist. The main different with gist is that wiki is allowing folder. So we can sort the files regardless where the folder that contained the file is located. 

```note
Gists and Wiki are actually Git repositories, which means that you can fork or clone any gist, even if you aren't the original author. _([GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists#about-gists))_

This eleven (11) things will be discussed later in _[identition zones](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)_.

## Streaching Structure

In [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), there is vector is known as _[eigenvector](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Eigenvector.html)_, a nonzero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when linear transformation is applied to it.

```note
The eigenvectors of the matrix (red lines) are the two special directions such that every point on them will just slide on them _([Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eigenvectors_of_a_linear_operator.gif))_.
```

[![Eigenvectors_of_a_linear_operator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/228168805-ab93185d-4172-4284-8459-040e2f8797d4.gif)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#partition-function)

These features are the solution to arrange 30 files located in in four (4) of zone folders as the lexer to cope with the _[Prime Spin](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#prime-hexagon)_ and _[MEC30 Structure](https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity)_.

```note
Eigenvalues are often introduced in the context of linear algebra or matrix theory. Historically, however, they arose in the study of ***quadratic forms and differential equations***. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler studied the rotational motion of a rigid body, and discovered the importance of the principal axes.[a] Joseph-Louis Lagrange realized that ***the principal axes are the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix*** _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors))_
```

Here we are using the [inverse function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function) to [exponentiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation) by `3 x 6 = 18` spins. This is what we mean by the ***multiplication zones*** that is applied to each of _[addition zones](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_.

```tip
The three (3) minor hexagons are surrounded by the primes (19, 43, 71) which is close to ***the multiplication of six (6)*** with 3, 7, 12 to 18, 42, 72. One of a mysterious thing is that `19 Ã— 6 = 43 + 71` where âˆ†1 is balancing and keep them to remain stay on the 18s scheme. Therefore we use the primes ***43 and 71*** as corresponding _[eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues)_ which is the factor by which the eigenvector is [scaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors#Overview).
```
***19 x 6 = 43 + 71 = 114***

This scheme is showing a parsering result by repeating the positions in the next step. These positions: `1 7 11 13 17 19 23 29` refer as ***the basic system of MEC30***.

```note
Because the value 30 is the first (common) product of the first 3 primes. ***And this 30th order repeats itself to infinity. Even in the first 30s system, therefore, the positions are fixed in which the number information positions itself to infinity***. We call it the first member of the MEC 30. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en))_ 
```

[![MEC30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png)](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation)

Base on the above streching on 18s structure and repeating on MEC30 it is clear that there will be a residual vector by the higher primes. So where would they go?

```tip
Since the higher primes is more than 71 then the most logical position will be in the 11s somewhere in the third of minor hexagon. By the MEC30 we can see that they will be pushed to and ***ended up on the prime 13***.
```

You may see this scheme is build by 3 (three) layers where the next layer will continue the primes object by carrying the tensor of _primes 43 and 71_ of previous layer.

So then a question is arised. Where is this vector flowing in the 18s?<br>
Let's discuss it first with the _[exponentiation zones](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/)_.

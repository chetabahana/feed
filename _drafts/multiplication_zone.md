## Assigning a lexer

By prime hexagon we can see that the number seven (7), hold the power to make the prime spin remain on the track. This power is then transfered to ***twelve (12) spins***. 

```note
Surprisingly, the 24-cell hexagon confines all natural numbers. The reason: no prime numbers occupy a cell with a right or left wall on the t-hexagonâ€™s outer boundary, other than 2 and 3, the initial primes that forced the number line into this complex coil. Without a prime number in the outer set of triangles, the number line does not change to an outward course and remains forever contained in the 24 cells shown above. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_
```

[![Structure: Minor Hexagons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/253148724-8dffc1e4-e2a9-478e-ae13-7bb1c0303406.png)](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-minor-hexagons)

Therefore this 12's treatment will involve at least ***11 groups of runner*** and one (1) profile of the 7's transformation. We collect them in [`11 + 7 = 18 gists`](https://gist.github.com/eq19) as below.

```tip
Gists provide a simple way to share code snippets with others. Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned. If you are signed in to GitHub when you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to your gist home page. _([GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists#about-gists))_

By the prime hexagon the 19th spin is touching back to the first node. So the workflow will be proceeded as ***bilateral way*** and twisted them by such a kind of _[double strands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair)_.

We concluded later on that this bilateral would not come to be possible if only one (1) profile is assigned. Therefore we add another profile so they would be `11 + 2 = 13's`.

These are the ones that bring [`11 + 13 = 24 cell hexagons`](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs).

## Orbital structure

The the main reason of assigning two (2) profiles instead of only one (1) is that we have to accommodate the two (2) major types of primes numbers.

```note
This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for N to be a prime as noted, for example, by N= 6(4)+1= 25, which is clearly composite. We note that each turn of the spiral equals an increase of six units. This means that we have a mod(6) situation allowing us to write: N mod(6)=6n+1 or N mod(6)=6n-1 (equivalent to 6n+5). _([HexSpiral-Pdf](https://mae.ufl.edu/~uhk/HEX-SPIRAL-N.pdf))_
```

![twin primes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/199381132-1c2beef1-d8a1-4bdf-8e11-37c71c5aaa39.png)

There are primes number called twin primes. By a group of number ***up to 31*** they have a profile reflect module 6 view of numbers as happens with the minor hexagons.

```note
Cell types are interesting, but they simply reflect a ***modulo 6 view of numbers***.  More interesting are the six internal hexagons within the Prime Hexagon.  Like the Prime Hexagon, they are newly discovered.   The minor hexagons form solely from the order, and type, of primes along the number line _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/))_.
```

By our project the scheme will be treated as the sun and the moon orbit where this 31 is the maximum days of a month:

```

So by the _[exponentiation zone](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/)_ they will end up as 7 days (***sun***) and 12 months (***moon***) while the 11 will represent the ones outside the orbit (***stars*** or ***galaxies***).

This eleven (11) things will be discussed later in _[identition zones](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)_.

## MEC30 Structure

We are going to manage the relation of all the involved things in the scheme above using wiki and gist available by GitHub. Here is the example of the code:

```

Gists and Wiki are actually Git repositories, which means that you can fork or clone any gist, even if you aren't the original author. The wiki will look like as below;

```tip
Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. _([GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis))_
```

[![37 wiki's files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/267547466-d10df532-d222-44a8-90a4-ad18386301c5.jpg)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/wiki)

The main different with gist is that wiki is allowing folder. So we can sort the files regardless where the folder that contained the file is located. 

[![MEC30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png)](https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity)

This feature are the solution to arrange 30 files located in in four (4) of zone folders to cope with the _[Prime Spin](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#prime-hexagon)_ and _[MEC30 Structure](https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity)_. Let's find what we can do with it.

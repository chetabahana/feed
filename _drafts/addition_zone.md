# Addition Zones (1-18)

Addition is the form of an expression set equal to zero as the ***additive identity*** which is common practice in several areas of mathematics.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

By the _[Euler's identity](https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity)_ this addition should form as one (1) unit of an object.<br>For further on let's call this unit as ***the base unit***.

## Prime Hexagon

Below is the list of primes spin along with their position, the polarity of the number, and the prime hexagon's overall rotation [within 1000 numbers](https://github.com/tsgallion/prime-hexagon/blob/master/tests/good-0000-1000-01.txt).

```note
[The Prime Hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/) is a mathematical structure developed by mathematician _[Tad Gallion](https://www.hexspin.com/about-me/)_. A Prime Hexagon is formed when integers are sequentially added to a field of tessellating equilateral triangles, where the path of the integers is changed whenever a prime number is encountered _([GitHub: kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon](https://github.com/kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon#prime-hexagon))_.

Including the 1st (2) and 2nd prime (3) all together will have a total of ***168 primes***. The number of 168 it self is in between 39th (167) and 40th prime (173).

```note
Each time a prime number is encountered, the spin or â€˜wall preferenceâ€™ is switched. So, from the first cell, exit from 2â€™s left side. This sets the spin to left and the next cell is 3, a prime, so switches to right. 4 is not prime and continues right. 5 is prime, so switch to left and so on. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_
```

[![Defining the Prime Hexagon](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/36aeac77-ecb2-4c94-b2ea-fe0f8b7e391c)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

The most obvious interesting feature of this prime hexagon is it confines all numbers of primes spin! That is, as the number line winds about toward infinity, bending around prime numbers, it never exits the ***24 cells***.

## Structure: True Prime Pairs

The tessellating field of equilateral triangles fills with numbers, with spin orientation flipping with each prime number encountered, creating ***3 minor hexagons*** which is identical with 18's structure of _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_.

```
$True Prime Pairs:
(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)

      |      |     |  1  |

      |      +-----+-----+
      |  2   |     |  5  | (7)
      |      |  3  +-----+
      |      |     |  6  |
------+------+-----+-----+------      } (36)
      |      |     |  7  |
      |      |  4  +-----+
      |  3   |     |  8  | (11)
      |      +-----+-----+
      |      |     |  9  |
  2   +------|  5  +-----+-----
      |      |     |  10 |
      |      |-----+-----+
      |  4   |     |  11 | (13)
      |      |  6  +-----+
      |      |     |  12 |
------+------+-----+-----+------------------
      |      |     |  13 |
      |      |  7  +-----+
      |  5   |     |  14 | (17)
      |      |-----+-----+
      |      |     |  15 |
  3   +------+  8  +-----+-----       } (36)
      |      |     |  16 |
      |      |-----+-----+
      |  6   |     |  17 | (19)
      |      |  9  +-----+
      |      |     |  18 |
------|------|-----+-----+------
```

The fact is that the number of 168 divided by 24 is ***exactly seven (7)***. So there should be a tight connection between the prime within 1000 with the _[24-cell hexagon](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#assigning-a-lexer)_.

```note
A Prime Hexagon is formed when integers are sequentially added to a field of tessellating equilateral triangles, where the path of the integers is changed whenever a prime number is encountered. Since prime numbers are never multiples of two or three, all numbers from "2" to infinity are confined within a ***24-cell hexagon*** _([GitHub: kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon](https://github.com/kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon#prime-hexagon))_.
```

[![Euler Partition](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/b73fec0f-1798-4679-bbc2-ed6060484543)](https://eq19.com/identition/#euler-partition)

You may also notice that there are twists and turns until 19 abuts 2 therefore this addition zone takes only the seven (7) primes out of the 18's structure. 

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/269957059-2f8144a0-c071-4ab3-9ee2-40d24ab1efe4.jpg)

So there would be the empty spaces for `18 - 7 = 11` numbers. By our project these spaces will be filled by all of the eleven (11) members of ***[identition zones](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)***.

[![partitions](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/deb0e309-2178-4dc5-a1d6-30c81c4a8305)](https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity)

This is what we mean by _addition_ and it happens whenever a cycle is restarted. The above seven (7) primes will act then as ***[their partitions](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#euler-partition)***.

## Structure: Minor Hexagons

When you refer to the website of prime hexagon, there are statements mentioned by the provider which bring us in to an attention. We put some of them below.

```note
Similarly, I have a six colored dice in the form of the hexagon.  If I take a known, logical sequence of numbers, say 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and look at their spins in the hexagon, the resulting colors associated with each number should appear random â€“ ***unless the sequence Iâ€™m investigating is linked to the nature of the prime numbers***.
```

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74550123-6dd1d680-4f83-11ea-8810-3b8f4f50a9c0.png)

```note
That is, if the powers of 10 all returned with blue spin, or as a series of rainbows, or evenly alternating colors or other non-random results, ***then Iâ€™d say prime numbers appear to have a linkage to 10.  I may not know what the the linkage is, just that it appears to exist*** _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/))_.
```

There is one other thing with this prime hexagon. The developer found that phi and its members have a pisano period if the resulting fractional numbers are truncated:

```note
I wondered if that property might hold for the incremental powers of phi as well. For this reason I chose to see numbers in the hexagon as quantum, and truncate off the decimal values to determine which integer cell they land in. That is what I found. Phi and its members have a pisano period if the resulting fractional numbers are truncated _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/phi-not-pi-and-why-i-truncate-to-determine-integer-values/))_.
```

[![truncated fractional numbers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/229198281-8dbd72fb-cd0b-46c3-8a2c-ddc66107333e.png)](https://www.hexspin.com/phi-not-pi-and-why-i-truncate-to-determine-integer-values/)

It would mean that there should be a crucial fraction with the residual of decimal value. In this project we are going to analyze it using a javascript library called _[Chevrotain](https://dev.to/codingwithadam/introduction-to-lexers-parsers-and-interpreters-with-chevrotain-5c7b)_.

[![Lexers, Parsers and Interpreters with Chevrotain](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/241206698-b4128e07-81ea-4eab-a14a-5d881836b924.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/)

It can be used to build parsers/compilers/interpreters for various use cases ranging from simple config files to full fledged programming languages.

You may find that the rest of topics will concern mainly to this matter.
